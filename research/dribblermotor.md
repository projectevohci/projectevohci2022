 10 :40pm: Dribbler motor was too fat and heavy, although it met criteria, it does not meet the weight

had to find for alternatives

went online and read up

basically this website has the impt shit

https://www.rotordronepro.com/understanding-kv-ratings/

so, the higher the KV = more heat = sucks ass = weak ass torque cos the whatever RPM stupid shit is like fucking calculated when the motor is "free moving" so the motor is not underload which is not what we want as our dribbler is always under load

asked the seniors why they were using a super low kv motor 820kV

referred to other lw teams and saw that they were using the A2208 not the A2212 which i was considering to use

shit is fucking autism

why the senior gear down cos the Open ball light as fuck

11:52pm : Now senior said the dribbler is useless cos the matches are all so fast fucking pased what fuck

why am i here just to suffer

   anw ir ball need higher rpm

   smaller motor usually rpm bigger so

   maybe ur gearing wont even have to change at all

   win

lightweight matches are super fast paced lol if they ram into u and your dribbler is shit and loses control of the ball then there really isnt a point in having 1
